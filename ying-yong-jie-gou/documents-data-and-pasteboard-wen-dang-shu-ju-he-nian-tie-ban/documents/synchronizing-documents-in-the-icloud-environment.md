# Synchronizing documents in the iCloud environment

> Sample Code

## [Overview](synchronizing-documents-in-the-icloud-environment.md#overview) <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

As technology advances, more and more people generate their digital assets from different devices, and expect those assets to synchronize seamlessly. To support such use cases, apps need to discover the assets, as well as their changes, from all the devices, and present the user with a consistent view.

This sample demonstrates how to discover and synchronize documents in the iCloud environment, and manage them to achieve high performance and a low memory footprint. These _documents_ can be the digital assets or any user data.

The sample also demonstrates how to publish an iCloud container to iCloud Drive so that the user can access the containerâ€™s `Documents` folder from other apps. Additionally, it shows how to support the Open-in-Place feature, which allows the user to launch an app by tapping a document in Files, and then edit it directly.
